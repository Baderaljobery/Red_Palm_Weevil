## Red Plam Weevil
Introduction
This report addresses the Red Palm Weevil, widely recognized as a lethal pest to palm trees. It is imperative that we scrutinize this issue, given its profound impact on farmers specifically and the general public at large.


What is Red Plam Weevil ?
The Red Palm Weevil (Rhynchophorus ferrugineus) is widely regarded as the most devastating pest affecting palm trees globally. Native to Southeast Asia, this invasive beetle poses a critical threat to date palms and the agricultural sector. The primary danger lies in its larval stage, where the weevil bores into the palm's trunk, destroying the internal vascular system and structural integrity of the tree. Often undetected until severe damage has occurred, infestations frequently lead to the collapse and death of the palm, causing significant economic losses for farmers and threatening regional food security.


Choose the dataset
The dataset was selected from the open data platform, which includes all government data that is permitted for public release and use. The selected data was provided by the Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture under the title "Inspection of Palm Trees for Red Palm Weevil.

Stages of the data analysis process
•	Initially, the data is explored and understood from all aspects so that we can analyze and work on it without problems in the future. The understanding stage is very important.
•	This is followed by a data cleaning phase to remove problems and unwanted columns or rows in order to make the data clear, easy to understand and process without any errors, and to delete all duplicates.
•	We conclude with what is called EDA, where we review and analyze the data according to the desired perspective, extracting concepts and relationships that enable us to understand the overall picture and develop it in the future.

Challenges and difficulties
-	Arabic names
-	Empty and useless rows
-	The data type is object not numerical
-	More than one dataset



Project deployment stages
-	Create a repositories in GitHub:
We create a place on GitHub to store the required data and files for easy access and publishing.
-	Arrange files:
We must organize the files in the most suitable way in order to know the path of each required file.
-	Using streamlit for deploy:
We use Streamlit as a platform to place the work within it and then publish it.
-	Deploy the work:
At this stage, the project has been Deployed online and anyone can access it.

What is the added value of this project?
Through this initiative, we can generate critical analytical insights, ranging from quantifying palm tree populations across the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to evaluating inspection protocols and identifying operational hotspots. Furthermore, this tool enables us to pinpoint the root causes of infestation, contain the spread, and visualize its geographical distribution.

The potential value derived from this program is virtually limitless, offering versatile data adaptable to various strategic objectives. In conclusion, the Red Palm Weevil represents a devastating agricultural threat. It is our collective obligation to address this crisis effectively and combat this pest using every available measure.
